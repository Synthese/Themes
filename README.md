PHP-Fusion Core
=================
The version used of the PHP-Fusion CMS is Version 9, cloned on 27 March 2016. Any substantial upgrades on the core package may not reflect on this repository. If you need the latest PHP-Fusion CMS, be sure to get the official releases and not the copies inherited in this repo.

Setup
=======
For each theme, a new branch will be set up. Focus will be put on theme_includes.php functions that could vary per branch. Please run a diff to check on any possible modifications on the core files.

Always in-Development
=========================
All themes under the repository will be constantly developed as-is basis. Therefore, there should be no roadmap for this archive.
